UI-REFRESH-f: the app shell. A top bar (page title; the Under the hood switch, a live status chip and the theme control), the sidebar, top bar, status bar and Settings sub-navigation on the chrome material on a Mac only (`data-os` is set at start-up; Windows, Linux and reduced transparency stay solid), one sliding nav highlight, a bottom bar at 360 px, route changes through the View Transitions API (instant with reduced motion or where missing), Home (at `/settings/home` for now) and Appearance in the menu and router, and an inert background behind every Sheet and dialog. The chrome material opacity is raised from 72 % to 85 % so the chrome text meets WCAG 2.1 AA over the worst content under it. The old approval page copies the new Home entry in its fixed sidebar list.
